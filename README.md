# SWE_Python
### Dr. Matthew Smith, Swinburne University of Technology
Demonstration of code optimization through vectorization for the 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE) using Python and the SHLL method.

### Requirements
If you are using your own computer to run the main script (sw.py): python 2.7 with the numpy and matplotlib modules installed. To run the Jupyter notebook, you'll
also need to have it set up on your local machine. For users of Swinburne's OzStar supercomputer, a script is included for loading the appropriate modules (script.sh).

To run the code on Ozstar: (i) load the modules (. script.sh) and then (ii) type python sw.py. For those running the Jupyter notebook file, 
open the notebook server and then find your file.
